# OpenCV_Smile_Detect
A Python3 program that uses a Raspberry Pi (v3 B+) and OpenCV to detect faces, eyes, and smiles.
I expect the code will work on any machine with a camera that OpenCV can use, and Python 3.

OpenCV set up for a Pi 3 B+

It worked for me when I followed all the dependency steps. I think I must have missed one the first time I tried it as step 4 went for hours until I turned the Pi off.

The code and data files came from: https://www.electromaker.io/project/view/open-cv--face-eyes--smile-detection-with-raspberry-pi

I have tweaked the code very slightly, but still can't get Smile detection to work, just Face and Eyes, so I'll keep playing with it.
